# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
images = Image.create([{ link: 'teste', product_id: 1 }, { link: 'aaaaaa', product_id: 2 }])
categories = Category.create([{name: 'categoria1' }, {name: 'categoria2' }])
